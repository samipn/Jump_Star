Jump Star

This is a jump physics game made by Samip Niraula using the Phaser framework.

The player uses the arrow keys to move as continuous inputs, and they automatically jump. This is an endless game, so the player is trying to get as many stars as possible. 

I added transition effects between screens, as well as a jumping animation.

I also added a counter to count how many stars the player has collected, and a highscore tracker
that updates in real time and saves the player's highscore even after closing the game. 

I created all assets by myself. For the player, I decided to have a space/star theme so the player themselves is a star. 

Then for the platforms I decided to make 
asteroids using the simple shape tool. 

For the stars that the player collects I also used a simple shape tool. 

Finally, for the background, I used Photoshop to
make a somewhat realistic looking space background.

I hope you enjoy my game!
